Description: Nonparametric tests for clustered data in pre-post intervention design documented in Cui and Harrar (2021) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201900310> and Harrar and Cui (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2022.05.009>. Other than the main test results mentioned in the reference paper, this package also provides a function to calculate the sample size allocations for the input long format data set, and also a function for adjusted/unadjusted confidence intervals calculations. There are also functions to visualize the distribution of data across different intervention groups over time, and also the adjusted/unadjusted confidence intervals.
